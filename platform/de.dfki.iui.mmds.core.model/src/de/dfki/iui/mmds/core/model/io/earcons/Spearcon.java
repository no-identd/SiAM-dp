 * A request to output a speech with additional effects processing, called Spearcon.
 * "Spearcons use spoken phrases sped up until they may no longer be recognized as speech. Building on the simplicity of creating speech cues mentioned earlier, spearcons can be created automatically by using basic text-to-speech software and an algorithm to speed up the phrase. Each spearcon is unique due to the specific underlying speech phrase, which allows them to be both distinct but at the same time allows similar phrases to form families of related sounds, much like earcons." (Dingler et al., 2008)
