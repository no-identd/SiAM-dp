 * A request to output a non-speech audio signal representing a real-world concept.
 * "Auditory icons are brief sounds that represent objects, functions, and actions. They take advantage of the userï¿½s prior knowledge and natural auditory associations with sound sources and causes. They are meant to be the auditory equivalent of visual icons that are broadly used in personal computing, representing objects or processes through graphical symbols. [...] As an example, the sound of running water or a paper towel dispenser can be used to represent restrooms." (Dingler et al., 2008)
