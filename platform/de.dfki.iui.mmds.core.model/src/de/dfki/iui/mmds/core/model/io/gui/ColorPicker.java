 * The ColorPicker control lets users select a color from a drop-down swatch panel (palette). It initially appears as a preview sample with the selected color. When a user selects the control, a color swatch panel appears. The panel includes a sample of the selected color and a color swatch panel. By default, the swatch panel displays the web-safe colors (216 colors, where each of the three primary colors has a value that is a multiple of 33, such as #CC0066).
